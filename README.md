# HEAD:Holistic Evolutionary Autonomous Driving
HEAD is a holistic suite of evolutionary autonomous driving software, based on the MetaDrive simulation platform, that seamlessly imports driving scenarios, uploads training models, and efficiently performs continuous training designed to significantly improve the performance of arbitrary models.
## Introduction
**HEAD (Holistic Evolutionary Autonomous Driving)** is an Autonomous Driving Platform with the following key features: 
- **A General Self-Evolutionary Autonomous Driving Software Tool**: It combines learning-based, optimization-based, and rule-based algorithms to efficiently handle complex driving scenarios and ensure safety and performance.
- **Integration with Simulation Testing**: It is deeply integrated with the MetaDrive simulation platform, enabling comprehensive testing and optimization.
- **A Closed-Loop Data-Driven Platform**: It provides a complete closed-loop system from scenario generation to algorithm evolution, enhancing adaptability and reliability in unseen scenarios through adversarial testing and continuous learning.

## 🔧Quick Start
1. **Clone the repo**

   Start by cloning the HEAD repository to your local machine:
    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/TJHuangteam/HEAD.git
    cd HEAD
   ```
2. **Conda Env Settings and Install Dependencies**
    ``` bash
    conda create -n HEAD python=3.9
    conda activate HEAD
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   
## Adversarial Loop
The adversarial loop refers to a training framework where adversarial examples or environmental perturbations are introduced to improve the robustness and generalization ability of a model. 
\
Adversarial loops are commonly used in reinforcement learning and security research to enhance an agent's adaptability to uncertain and harsh environments.
1. **Enter Adversarial Loop**
   ```bash
   cd ./HEAD/adversarial_loop
   ```
2. **Launch Basic Experiment**
   ```bash
   python training_main.py
   ```

## Algorithmic Evolution Loop
The algorithmic evolution loop is a machine learning strategy that simulates the biological process of evolution, involving the competition and cooperation of multiple algorithms. 
\
The algorithmic evolution loop is widely used in fields such as automated machine learning and reinforcement learning to automatically optimize algorithm architectures or strategies.
1. **Enter Algorithmic Evolution Loop**

2. **Launch Basic Experiment**

## Self-Learning Loop
A self-learning loop is an unsupervised learning strategy where the model learns through self-supervision. 
\
The self-training loop is commonly used in scenarios with limited labeled data or high annotation costs, such as image classification and natural language processing.
1. **Enter Self-Learning Loop**
   ```bash
   cd ./HEAD/self-learning_loop
   ```
   
2. **Real Scenario Reproduction**
   ```bash
   cd ./scenario_reproduction
   ```
   1. Convert the recorded bag files from the actual vehicle to csv files
   \
   PS: Please note your ROS version
   `rostopic echo -b input.bag -p /output > output.csv`
   2. In **obj_info.py**, load your bag file, extract vehicle and pedestrian information, and store it as an **obj_info.pkl** file.
   3. Load the map osm file, and in **osm_scenario.py**, extract road information and save in **map_features.pkl**.
   4. In **run_main.py**, load vehicle and pedestrian information **obj_info.pkl** and  map lane information **map_features.pkl**, integrate the information into  `ScenarioDescription` format for reproduction in metadrive, and save in the `dataset/`.
   5. If you'd like to visualize the transferred scenario, please run:
      ```bash
      python -m scenarionet.sim -d /path_to_your scenario_reproduction/dataset --render 2D/3D
      ```
3. **Launch Basic Experiment**

Run **SAC\_multi\_scenario\_con.py**
\
Set the `--database_path` to processed dataset for training and evaluation.
\
This file is the main function for training and evaluating the reinforcement learning agent.
\
The training and testing process can be viewed online via tensorboard:
`tensorboard --logdir = /path_to_your_model/test`
\
PS: You can also load public datasets such as waymo, nuscenes, nuplan(which need to be processed by scenarionet's convert to a unified format)
## Typical Experiments Result

### Algorithmic Evolution Loop
![Algorithmic Evolution Loop Result](./assets/experiment.jpg)
The experimental results demonstrate that the **Algorithmic Evolution Loop**, powered by the Mixture of Progressive Experts (MoPE), 
significantly improves the performance of autonomous driving systems. 
By leveraging gradual optimization, dynamic expansion of the expert network, and adaptive mechanisms, this loop enables the system to effectively handle complex and edge cases. 
Through iterative learning from new failure cases and continuous adaptation in dynamic environments, the loop drives rapid model evolution, leading to enhanced performance and robustness over time.




#### HEAD Evolution Experiment
![HEAD Evolution Experiment](./assets/experiment_2.jpg)
The experimental results on the **HEAD** platform demonstrate a significant improvement in autonomous driving system performance in complex and uncertain scenarios.
Through the three-round self-learning loop, the agent’s rewards steadily increased, showcasing its ability to adapt progressively to challenging environments. 
In contrast, during the self-adversarial loop, the reward notably decreased, highlighting the effectiveness of adversarial scenarios in uncovering system weaknesses and driving further evolution. 
Models trained over multiple rounds outperformed those trained in a single self-learning round, validating the superiority of this iterative self-evolution mechanism. 
These findings confirm that **HEAD Evolution** paradigm enhances the intelligence and adaptability of autonomous driving systems.
